    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>As computer scientists, our team is committed to applying courage, focus, and technical excellence to solve complex problems. Our strength lies in our open and transparent communication, ensuring every solution we deliver is robust, scalable, and reflective of our collective expertise in coding and design.</p>
    <h3> Team Rules</h3> <ul class="team-rules">
        <li><strong>Transparency & Openness:</strong> If you feel </strong>uncertainty</strong> about your work, or if you are unable to contribute due to any circumstance, let other team members know </strong>as soon as possible</strong>. This immediate communication makes the flow of work much easier for everybody involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Commitment & Focus (Just Show Up):</strong> We maintain mutual </strong>Commitment</strong> to the common goal by being equally motivated and actively present. We will use our shared external platform for open communication and scheduling additional meetings </strong>AS NEEDED</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Courage & Handling Delays:</strong> If a member is </strong>falling behind schedule</strong>, they must exhibit </strong>Courage</strong> by immediately raising the issue (</strong>Transparency</strong>). The rest of the team will then collectively </strong>Focus</strong> on re-prioritizing tasks and providing support to get the work back on track.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect & Persistence (Uncooperative Member):</strong> We approach collaboration with </strong>Respect</strong>. If dealing with an </strong>uncooperative team member</strong>, we will consistently reach out to them to see if there are ways we may be able to empower them to complete their work. Communication is key!</li>
